# Ride Along
Ride Along is a web application that connects mountain bikers by providing a platform where they can arrange and join in rides with others. Using Ride Along, mountain bikers will have the ability to browse available rides that others have created. Rides all have a date, time and place, and anyone can create them! 

Once you have joined a ride, all you need to do is show up at the place listed at the time and day that the ride is organised for! If you can no longer make it, no worries, you can also leave the ride.

## Developers
Ride Along is being developed by Aidan Cushman, Domingo Ag√ºero and Veronika Luthar for the INFO310 Software Project Management paper.
